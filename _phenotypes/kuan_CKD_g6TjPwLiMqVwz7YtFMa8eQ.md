### Implementation 
<pre>Apply modified CALIBER 'Chronic Kidney Disease' algorithm in CPRD primary care data as follows:

A patient is defined as having had CKD stage 3 or above at a specified date:

IF egfr_ckdepi recorded on or before specified date, THEN 
IF egfr_ckdepi <60 ml/min on the most recent date (index date) before the specified date
AND
IF egfr_ckdepi <60 ml/min on any date greater than 90 days BEFORE the index date above
THEN classify as having CKD3 or above
ELSE the patient is not defined as having CKD stage 3 or above.

Where egfr_ckdepi up to and including 31 Dec 2013 is defined as: 
egfr_ckdepi = 141 * min(crea_gprd * 0.010746 / K, 1)^alpha
* max(crea_gprd * 0.010746 / K, 1)^-1.209 
* 0.993^age * 1.018 [if female]  * 1.159 [if black]

where:
alpha = -0.329 for females, -0.411 for males
K = 0.7 for females, 0.9 for males

Where egfr_ckdepi from and including 1 Jan 2014 is defined as: 
egfr_ckdepi = 141 * min(crea_gprd * 0.010746 / K, 1)^alpha
* max(crea_gprd * 0.0.011312/ K, 1)^-1.209 
* 0.993^age * 1.018 [if female]  * 1.159 [if black]

where:
alpha = -0.329 for females, -0.411 for males
K = 0.7 for females, 0.9 for males

Where crea_gprd is defined as:
IF enttype = 165 [Serum creatinine] 
AND data1 [Operator] = 3 ["="] AND data2 [Value] > 0
THEN crea_gprd = data2</pre>
